Conventional topology optimisation algorithms offer a benefit of feasible optimised structure for a given problem but has a drawback in terms of 
its computational cost because of large number of iterations and design variables.

In this project, a deep learning based optimization is performed to determine a near optimal structure without any iterations.

Firstly, supervised learning is performed to find an optimal structure from a training dataset, 

which includes information on boundary conditions and optimization settings (mass fraction) of the corresponding optimized structure.

Then a more refined structure is predicted from a GAN architecture.

By verification with the test data, the proposed method is able to find a near optimized structure without time consuming iterative process.
